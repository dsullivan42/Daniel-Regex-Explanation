# Matching a URL

A regex (regular expression) is a sequence of characters that are used to define search patterns. These can be a single character, or a multi character complicated pattern. When implemented into code, we can use regex to find patterns of characters within a string, split a string into an array of substrings, or replace a matched substring with a replacement substring. A common use for these regex, are for validation for user inputs. Overall, regex are extremely useful tools, for coders to utilize within their code. 

## Summary

The regex that I will be using today, will be matching a URL, or, `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`. Regex can be used in this case, for the validation in the format. When user's input the URL, the regex will work in ensuring that the url formatting for the web address, is valid.
